### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Working on: deepening my knowledge in data science
- Learning about: the theory behind linear regression with [this edX course](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH125.7x+1T2021/home)
- Ask me about: entropy
- Fun fact: cats have twice the neurons in their cerebral cortex as dogs
