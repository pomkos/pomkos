# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Working on: breaking into the data science sector
- Current pet project: creating interactive Streamlit sites for past ML projects
- Learning about: the digital nomadic life, and how to integrate working out into it
- Ask me about: entropy, Parkinson's, exercise
- Fun fact: cats have twice the neurons in their cerebral cortex as dogs
